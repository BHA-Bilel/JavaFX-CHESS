## General info
This project is the prior to many similar ones, so think of it as a third step to reaching a final goal.

After coding [Checkers](https://github.com/BHA-Bilel/JavaFX-CHECKERS) this was a piece of cake considering their similarity, once again my ultimate goal was to be able to tackle any game of this kind, and I'm quite confident that I reached that point.

## Game Charachteristics
- Turn based
- Multiplayer (no AI)
- Tabletop view (2D)
- Distributed (client/server)
- Socket programming (TCP)
- Message oriented communication (except game app)
- Supports multiple resolutions thanks to JavaFX scaling
- Supports fullscreen mode
- Doesn't support castling

## How to play

![Main app gui](./screenshots/mainApp.png)
After connecting to the server, the main app gui is presented to the player, allowing him to enter any username, then either Host, Join a specific room through its ID, or Join public rooms.

![Join app gui](./screenshots/joinApp.png)
If the player chooses to play with random people, he will be presented with a list of public rooms

![Room app gui](./screenshots/roomApp.png)
After joining a **room** the player is presented with this gui, where he can start a **chat** with people already in the room, change his **name** or his **place**, and set his **ready** status; the host has in addition the ability to change the room's **privacy** to either public/private; **kick** someone, and to **start the game**; the host privileges are **passed** automatically to the next player if the host leaves the room

The game works as a regular Checkers game, but in a distributed environment, you can end the game without leaving the room using the **Return to..** menu at the top.

## Additional infos
- This project was developed intermittently due to other preoccupations, that's why I can't tell how much time it took me to complete it.
All the collection was initially developed in **Eclipse IDE** in late 2019, before I migrated to **Intellij IDEA** in 2021 to code the remaining parts while redesigning some parts to fit the new workflow model.

- This project wasn't my first nor my last experience coding in JavaFX, I'll do my best to publish other projects on my GitHub.

- **All** of the projects/repositories (so far) in my profile are produced by an **individual** effort, that I coded from **scratch**.
